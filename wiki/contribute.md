# Contribute to the Wiki

The [ScrubCraft](main_page) wiki is not like other wiki's. It is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is a free tool to host websites and projects directly from a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. This hosting strategy allows the ScrubScraft Community to host this wiki for free. This also has some disadvantages over a traditional wiki, like the complexity of contributing if you have never used GitHub before. Below is a step by step guide to contribute to the wiki.

## Don't Worry

While this can be confusing, and there are specific formates that need to be followed, we don't want you to be afraid of messing something up. You can't! All changes have to be approved before they go live on the site. If something you do breaks the site, we will fix it before it is published.

## GitHub Account

You will first need a GitHub account. Visit the [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/join) page to get started.

Fill in your details on the first page.

On the next page is a questionaire. You can fill this out however you wish. If you only plan to use the account to contribute to this wiki then select Other, None, Other and then click complete setup.

Finally you need to verify your email. Check your email for a link. On the What do you want to do first page, click skip for now at the bottom.

That's it, you now have a GitHub account.

## Add/Edit your first page

The first time you click one of the links at the top of this page to Add, Edit, or Delete. You will need to [Fork](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)>) the wiki repository.

After clicking this link you will be on the editor screen.

## How to Format

The pages in this wiki use a format language called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It is not difficult to use, here is a [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can see this [Example](example). Go to it and click edit page to see what it looks like.

### File Naming

All pages need to be named with the `.md` extention and use underscore (`_`) for spaces. Example: `wiki_example.md`.

### Title and Sections

The title of the page is to be the first line of the document and start with a single #. For example: `# Title`

Each section should have a heading that starts with 2 or more #. For example: `## Section` or `### Sub Section`

### Links

There are 3 kinds of links:

#### Internal Links

These links will link to other documents on the wiki. These show up in blue.

Code: `[Supporters](supporter)` - This will appear as: [Supporters](supporter).

#### Internal Links that do not exist

These links are to link to other documents that do not exist yet on the wiki. These show up in red and indicate that a page for this topic should be made. When clicked on, it will bring you to the add file page on GitHub.

The code is the same as internal links.

Code: `[Page not Found](page_not_found)` - This will appear as: [Page not Found](page_not_found)

#### External Links

These links are for any external link. These show up in blue and have a little icon to the right of the link.

Code: `[Google](https://google.com)` - This will appear as: [Google](https://google.com)

## Saving your changes

At the bottom of the editor is the proposal form. Down here you can give your edits a quick description. The second box is optional to give extended details or substantiation.

![Propose](assets/images/propose_new_file.png "Propose New File")

Next create a Pull Request. This is requesting us to add your changes to the wiki, we will review your pull request, add comments, make nessasary changes, and then publish.

![Pull Request](assets/images/pull_request.png "Pull Request")

It will ask you for details on the pull request. Because you only edited one page, you can just click create pull request to finish. If you edit multiple pages then fill in what was changed.

Now we will review the changes and publish them.

## The next edit

Now that you have Forked the repository. The next time you edit a page, you will go directly to the editor. I would encourage you to learn how Git and GitHub work. There are other ways of editing this wiki than the one described here.
